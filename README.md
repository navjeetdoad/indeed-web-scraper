# indeed-web-scraper
This is a program created in Python using the BeautifulSoup package. The application takes in input as to what the name of the job you are looking for is,
where it's located, the radius in kilometers from the destination you insert, and whether or not you want to see jobs which have been posted in the last 30 
days. Once the program has run, it computes a quick search by scrapping Indeed for this information, and then parses it and cleanly inserts the information
into a file titled "output.html", which creates an HTML file that contains a table with all of the information about the job results.
